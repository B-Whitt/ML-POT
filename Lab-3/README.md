This lab features the new Watson Studio Neural Network modeler, and Experiment Assistant to build, train, and test a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images. The dataset used is the CIFAR-10 dataset (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research), a collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms. 

## Objectives:

Upon completing the lab, you will: 

1. Set up data for the neural network modeler
1. Become familiar with the neural network modeler  
1. Become familiar with the Experiment Assistant
1. Train and deploy a neural network model
1. Classify images
