In this lab, you will use a Jupyter Notebook and the XGBoost library for breast cancer detection. The Jupyter notebook contains steps and code to get data from the IBM Watson Studio Community, create a predictive model, and start scoring new data. This notebook introduces commands for getting data and for basic data cleaning and exploration, model training, model persistance to Watson Machine Learning repository, model deployment, and scoring.

## Objectives:

Upon completing the lab, you will know how to:

1. Create a Jupyter IPython notebook from a URL
1. Load data from a URL
1. Build an XGBoost Model
1. Deploy the Model
1. Score using the Model. 

## Instructions:

### Step 1.  Log into your [DSX](http://datascience.ibm.com/) account, then select `View All Projects`, then select the project you created at the beginning of this proof of technology.

1. Click the `From URL` tab under `Create Notebook`.
1. Give the notebook a name in the `Name` field, for example `Titanic` and optionally you can give it a description.
1. In the Notebook URL field, use `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpatter/ML-POT/master/Lab-1/TitanicStudent.ipynb`.
1. Ensure that there is a `Spark Service` selected, then click the `Create Notebook` button on the bottom right of the screen.

### Step 4.  Follow the instructions in the notebook.
